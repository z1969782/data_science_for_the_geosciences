    "# Flow control: if / elif / else statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### ```if``` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic ```if``` statements are used for conditional execution of python code using a single test that generates a ```bool```. If the ```bool``` is ```True``` the code that \"belongs\" to the ```if``` statement is executed. If the ```bool``` is ```False```, the code is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the keyword ```if``` to your code: ```if```\n",
    "2. Add a space and then a test that is within parentheses: ```if (test)```\n",
    "3. Add a ```:``` immediately after the test: ```if (test):```\n",
    "4. Press enter and add code that starts 4 spaces from the left margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (test):\n",
    "    code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, ```code``` will only run if ```test``` is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addition changes our program type from sequential to conditional. In other words, not every line of code will be executed. What lines are or are not executed are based on the requirements of your program and the logic assocated with those requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you have a version of Blackboard that sends you a message saying \"Great job!\" whenever you get an assignment score above 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Great job!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wrote a simple sequential program like the one above, there would be no way to control if the message is sent or not. This would result in some students who did not score a 90% to get the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we want to conditionally execute lines of code using ```if``` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the previous example, the requirement of the program is that \"Great job!\" is only sent when an assignment score exceeds 90%. This is the \"english\" version of the requirements. To convert this into a Python version, you need to translate what \"exceeds 90%\" means, and note that you should probably use a ```>``` operator. Once you figure this out, you need to determine what goes on the left of the operator and what goes on the right. Typically, we put the variable or value being \"tested\" on the left, and the value it is being tested against on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "```score > 90```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling our discussion on ```bool```, the following examples would result in either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```False``` if score is 90 or less:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "print(score > 90) #output is False, since 85 is not greater than 90\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ```True``` if score is greater than 90:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "score = 95\n",
    "\n",
    "print(score > 90) #output is True, since 95 is greater than 90\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to add the test to the ```if``` syntax as defined above and add indented code below the ```if``` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "score = 95\n",
    "\n",
    "if (score > 90):\n",
    "    print(\"Great job!\")\n",
