    "# Python \"Loops\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see the words \"loops\" or \"looping\" in the context of coding, it refers to a specific type of flow control that allows the program to run the same lines of code many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a foundational part of almost all programming languages, and Python is no exception. It also allows programs to process immense amounts of data much faster than a human ever could. Thus, understanding loops is *incredibly* important for any non-trivial Python program. Examples of daily software tasks that use loops include reading and/or downloading data, serving a website, and producing graphics in a video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading files\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is often stored on your harddrive in a format that is not readable to humans if they were to visually inspect the data in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a \"png\" image of a cat might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/PNG-Gradient_hex.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A software package or web browser looks up the \"specifications\" of the file type (e.g. 'png') and then decodes the file into a representation that is interpretable by humans. The \"psuedocode\", or \"fake\" code that describes the process without implementing the actual, working code, would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while not end of file\n",
    "\n",
    "    read line\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if line data is a header\n",
    "        process header\n",
    "    elif line is image data\n",
    "        decode image data\n",
    "        add image data to a list\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        tell user there is an error\n",
    "        \n",
    "plot combined image data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the \"decoder\" would read every one of the lines in the file and use \"flags\" (instructions) in the data to decide what to do inside an if/elif/else structure. It would continue to do this until it read a \"end of file\" flag, at which point, it would stop reading the file. During the loop, the results would be saved to a composite data type like a ```list```. After the loop, the resulting data is then displayed as an image for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serving a website\n",
    "\n",
    "Code running on a web server that \"serves\" a website is a form of an \"event loop\". It continually checks for requests (events), and then executes code that can fulfill those requests. Depending on the scale of the server, it can check for requests many times a second. For example, the Amazon AWS system processes <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/happy-10th-birthday-aws-identity-and-access-management/>400 million requests *per second*</a>. \n",

    "### Running a video game\n",
    "\n",
    "Video game code is similar to website code in that it also has an \"event loop\". It continually checks for requests (events), and then executes code that can fulfill those requests. For example, a user may want to jump, and the code that displays the scene in the game must update the perspective of the 3D environment. Many games are \"60 FPS\", which requires the loop to update the scene 60 times a second (or more). If the scenes are complex or the computer is not up to the task, you will notice a \"lag\" where the change in the perspective is not as smooth as it would be in \"real life\". This could be due to complex scenarios (many characters or objects on the screen) or just normal variability in the GPU related to heat or background processes.\n",
